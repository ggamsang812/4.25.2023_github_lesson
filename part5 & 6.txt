part6
1. Make new repository in github.com
2. git init
3. git branch -M main
3-1. default value for main branch without github is "master" but for github use, you need to rename it to "main"
4. git remote add origin *address*
5. git push -u origin main
5-1. "-u" means remember => once you used -u and pushed, you don't need to use it again. You can just git push next time you need to push.
