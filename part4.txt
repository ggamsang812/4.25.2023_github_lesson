Part4  ---------
1. 3-way merge is the default option of merging branches
2. When there is nothing to merge (there is no new content in master branch and only in the new branch), fast-forward merge gets triggered
2-1. If you don't like the ff merge, you can force 3-way merge by => git merge --no-ff *branch name*
3. git branch -d *branch name* => deletes branch after merge
3-1. Deleting branch without merging them is with => git branch -D *branch name*
4. Use git rebase & merge when there is a branch that is short and simple
4-1. Downside is rebase get you lots of conflict 
4-2. *at the new created branch* git rebase *master branch*  => move to master branch => git merge *new branch*
5. squash and merge
5-1. For better git log
